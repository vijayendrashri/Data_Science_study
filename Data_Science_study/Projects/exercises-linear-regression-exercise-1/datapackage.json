{"name":"exercises_linear-regression-exercise-1","title":"Linear Regression Exercise 1","description":"Build an Ordinary Least Squares multiple regression model to predict cancer mortality rates by United States counties\n\n---\n{\"editor\":\"markdown\"}\n---\n# Multiple Linear Regression Challenge \n\n### **Background**\n\nThese data were aggregated from a number of sources including the American Community Survey (census.gov), clinicaltrials.gov, and cancer.gov. Most of the data preparation process can be viewed [here](https://data.world/nrippner/cancer-trials).\n\n### **Your Task: Build a multivariate Ordinary Least Squares regression model to predict *\"TARGET_deathRate\"***\n\n##### **Deliverables**\n\na. Your final model equation\n\nb. The statistical software output including (adjusted) R-squared and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n\nc. Your code file (if you used a programming language)\n\nd. Model diagnostics including statistics and visualizations:\n\n    - Assess linearity of model (parameters)\n    - Assess serial independence of errors\n    - Assess heteroskedasticity\n    - Assess normality of residual distribution\n    - Assess multicollinearity\n\ne. Model selection:\n\n    - Implement k-fold (k=10) cross validation \n    \nf. Your interpretation of the model\n\ng. Other factors to consider:\n\n    - Are there any outliers?\n    - Are there missing values?\n    - How will you handle categorical variables? \n\n****\n## **Good Luck and Have Fun!**\n****\n \n\n### **Data Dictionary**\n\nView Data Dictionary: [https://data.world/exercises/linear-regression-exercise-1/data-dictionary]\n\nKey:\n\n(*a*): years 2010-2016\n\n(*b*): 2013 Census Estimates\n\n-------------------------------------","homepage":"https://data.world/exercises/linear-regression-exercise-1","resources":[{"name":"avg_household_size","schema":{"fields":[{"name":"statefips","title":"statefips","type":"integer","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer","dwSourceId":"statefips"},{"name":"countyfips","title":"countyfips","type":"integer","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer","dwSourceId":"countyfips"},{"name":"avghouseholdsize","title":"avghouseholdsize","type":"number","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal","dwSourceId":"avghouseholdsize"},{"name":"geography","title":"geography","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"geography"}]},"path":"data/avg_household_size.csv","format":"csv"},{"name":"cancer_reg","schema":{"fields":[{"name":"avganncount","title":"avganncount","description":"Mean number of reported cases of cancer diagnosed annually (a)","type":"number","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal","dwSourceId":"avganncount"},{"name":"avgdeathsperyear","title":"avgdeathsperyear","description":"Mean number of reported mortalities due to cancer (a)","type":"integer","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer","dwSourceId":"avgdeathsperyear"},{"name":"target_deathrate","title":"target_deathrate","description":"Dependent variable.

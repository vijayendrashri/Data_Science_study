The CSRIC Best Practices Search Tool allows you to search CSRIC's collection of Best Practices using a variety of criteria including Network Type, Industry Role, Keywords, Priority Levels, and BP Number. The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council's (CSRIC) mission is to provide recommendations to the FCC to ensure, among other things, optimal security and reliability of communications systems, including telecommunications, media, and public safety. CSRICâ€™s members focus on a range of public safety and homeland security-related communications matters, including: (1) the reliability and security of communications systems and infrastructure, particularly mobile systems; (2) 911, Enhanced 911 (E911), and Next Generation 911 (NG911); and (3) emergency alerting. The CSRIC's recommendations will address the prevention and remediation of detrimental cyber events, the development of best practices to improve overall communications reliability, the availability and performance of communications services and emergency alerting during natural disasters, terrorist attacks, cyber security attacks or other events that result in exceptional strain on the communications infrastructure, the rapid restoration of communications services in the event of widespread or major disruptions and the steps communications providers can take to help secure end-users and servers.
